    "fh_posts is a Python package that transforms your Markdown and Jupyter Notebook blog posts into dynamic FastHTML content. It extracts YAML front matter using fastcore’s AttrDict for seamless metadata access and executes custom-tagged Python code blocks to render interactive posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Features\n",
    "- YAML Front Matter Parsing:\n",
    "Automatically extracts front matter (e.g., title, summary, date, tags) and makes it accessible via both dictionary and attribute notation.\n",
    "- Multi-Format Support:\n",
    "Process both Markdown (.md) and Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files.\n",
    "- Dynamic Code Execution:\n",
    "Custom code block tags let you decide whether to run code, hide code, or show output live.\n",
    "- FastHTML Integration:\n",
    "Render posts to FastHTML’s NotStr objects for lightning-fast blog content.\n",
    "- Link Handling:\n",
    "Optionally set all links to open in a new window when rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the package via pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pip install fh-posts\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn more about the package in the [documentation](https://decherd.github.io/fh_posts/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out this [blog post](https://www.drewecherd.com/post/fh-posts-introduction1) for a demonstration of the package in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Import the package:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from fh_posts.core import load_posts\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Tag your code blocks (explained below):\n",
    "````\n",
    "```python:run\n",
    "print(\"Hello, world!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "## Load the posts and render them:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Load posts from the 'posts' directory\n",
    "posts = load_posts('posts')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access metadata\n",
    "for post in posts:\n",
    "    print(post.title, post.date)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Render a post by its slug\n",
    "post = next(p for p in posts if p.slug == 'hello')\n",
    "html_output = post.render(open_links_new_window=True)\n",
    "print(html_output)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tags\n",
    "In a markdown file when you add a code block with triple backticks and python, append additional colon seperated tags to control how the code is run and rendered. All run code blocks will be executed in order and be in the namespace for the rest of the post. This should feel familiar to those who have used jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `python` (default) - output the code but don't run it\n",
    "- `python:run` - run and show the code and the output\n",
    "- `python:run:hide` - run the code but don't show the code or output\n",
    "- `python:run:hide-in` - run the code but don't show the code block, only the output\n",
    "- `python:run:hide-out` - run the code and show the output but don't show the code block\n",
    "- `python:run:hide-call` - run the code and show the output and the code block but don't show the call to the function (last line of code)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a notebook file all code cells are run by default. Add a `#|python` tag to the first line of any code cell to also have it appear as a code block in the post. All of the other tags for markdown posts apply to notebook posts as well. Having to add `run` each time is redundant since all cells are run but it keeps things consistent between markdown and notebook posts.\n",
